🔎 Project Overview

This project analyzes the potential impact of Artificial Intelligence on various job roles by 2030. Using exploratory data analysis (EDA), feature engineering, and statistical validation techniques, the study identifies which jobs are most vulnerable to automation and  the factors (salary, skills, experience, education) influence automation risk.

The objective is to derive data-driven insights that help understand workforce transformation trends in the AI era.

Strategic Job Vulnerability Analysis

❓ Key Business Questions

Which job categories are most vulnerable to automation by 2030?

Does higher salary reduce automation risk?

Does experience level protect against AI disruption?

Does higher education correlate with lower automation probability?

Which skill sets are most resilient to AI automation?


📊 Key Findings

✔ Majority of jobs fall under Medium Automation Risk

✔ Higher salaries do not necessarily guarantee lower automation probability

✔ Entry-level roles show higher automation exposure

✔ that automation risk distribution varies significantly across different required skills(skill_1 to skill_10)

✔ Certain high-paying jobs still face significant AI disruption risk

✔ Education level alone is not a strong protective factor — skill adaptability matters more

🎯 Final Strategic Conclusion

This analysis demonstrates that automation risk in the AI-driven economy is influenced more by task structure and technological exposure than by salary or education level alone.

While AI exposure increases in advanced roles, higher compensation does not guarantee protection from automation.

Risk distribution across experience and education levels suggests systemic transformation rather than isolated disruption.

Overall, workforce resilience will depend on adaptability, skill evolution, and strategic integration with AI technologies rather than traditional indicators of job security.
